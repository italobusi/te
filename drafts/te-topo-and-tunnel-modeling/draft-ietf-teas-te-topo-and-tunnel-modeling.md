#contributor:

--- abstract

   This document describes how to model TE topologies and tunnels for
   transport networks, by using the TE topology YANG model RFC8795
   and the TE tunnel YANG model RFCXXXX.

RFC Editor Note: Please replace XXXX with the RFC number assigned to draft-ietf-teas-yang-te.
