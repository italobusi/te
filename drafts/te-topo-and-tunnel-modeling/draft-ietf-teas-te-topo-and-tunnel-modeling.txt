         TE Topology and Tunnel Modeling for Transport Networks
             draft-ietf-teas-te-topo-and-tunnel-modeling-07

Abstract

   This document describes how to model TE topologies and tunnels for
   transport networks, by using the TE topology YANG model RFC8795 and
   the TE tunnel YANG model RFCXXXX.

   RFC Editor Note: Please replace XXXX with the RFC number assigned to
   draft-ietf-teas-yang-te.

1.  Introduction

   To be added

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Modeling Considerations

   To be continued

3.  Packet TE Types YANG Module

   Editors' note: Copy the text from [RFC8776] before WG LC if the
   RFC8876-bis approach is confirmed.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define networking protocols and data, hence
   are not directly responsible for security risks.
